- Find a new design for the app list (imitate Steam?)

### Low priority

- Show achievement progression when available
- Improve error handling (handle .expects, .unwraps, etc)

### Nices to have

- In utils, instead of calculating Steam install path every time, do it only once

### Help needed

- Support for Flatpak installs of Steam
- Snapcraft packaging
