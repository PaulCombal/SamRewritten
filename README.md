## What is SamRewritten?

SamRewritten is a tool that allows you to unlock, and lock again achievements on your Steam account.
Additionally, some apps and games expose stats which can also be edited using this tool. Achievements do not have any
financial value, however they are very desirable for bragging rights!

## Installation

On Linux, Fuse is required to launch AppImages. You might need to install it:

```shell
sudo apt install libfuse2 # Ubuntu/Debian
```

<!--
Additionally, Snap users can install SamRewritten using the App store or with the following command:
```bash
snap install samrewritten
```
-->

## Limitations

⚠️ On Linux, this tool is **only** compatible with:
* Snap installations of Steam
